### Introduction
Andrew, Feri, Eric, and Janice are 6th-semester students majoring in Computer Science at Universitas Bunda Mulia. We created a project titled "AI or Human" as part of our Python Web Framework Programming course final exam. The goal of this project is to detect and determine whether an image is AI generated image or a human made image. We use inference API from Hugging Face for our model and Streamlit as a part of our tech stack because Streamlit was enough to finish this project. We hope that this project could make an impact and benefit the readers.

### Executive Summary
The "AI or Human" project aims to detect and determine whether an image is an AI-generated image or a human-generated image.

This project will be implemented in two phases. The first phase is to design the interface for the web application. The second phase focuses on building coding applications using APIs from Hugging Face for the model and Streamlit.

The success that is expected and what is measured from this project is how many input photos are successfully detected according to the classification of the model used.

The project is expected to take three months to complete, with a total budget of $10,000.
